Every good blog should reference other good blogs. It's the way of nature.
Following is a random-ordered list of blogs, videos and other resources I've consumed while evolving as a data scientist.
Some of them are more basic (good for beginners), while others are more suitable for advanced readers.


* [varianceexplained](http://varianceexplained.org) is a great blog by David Robinson, a data scientist at stackoverflow.
  It contains many great case studies.
* [mathematicalmonk](https://www.youtube.com/user/mathematicalmonk/playlists) contains several lectures series.
  I saw two of them: the *probability primer* (which lays some foundations of probability; suitable for those who want
  to freshen up their probability knowledge), and the *machine learning* series which I can't recommend highly enough
  (it covers many algorithms with detailed mathematical explanations, but not too detailed to get you overwhelmed).
* [jbstatistics](http://www.jbstatistics.com) contains introductory statistics videos with basic examples of real data.
  Great for learning how to properly perform hypothesis tests and calculate confidence intervals.
* [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io) has a nice neural networks blog.
  Specifically, I highly recommend the post about [Neural Networks, Types, and Functional Programming](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-NN-Types-FP/).
* [Probably Overthinking It](http://allendowney.blogspot.co.il) is yet another great statistics blog.
  Take [there is only one test](http://allendowney.blogspot.co.il/2011/05/there-is-only-one-test.html) for example.
* [Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2) is a nice online book about probability and statistics (from the author of the *Probably Overthinking It* blog).
  It delivers all its ideas using python. It covers basic material, albeit too long and time consuming.
  I recommend it to those of you who want to get a better practical grasp of the material and have plenty of time (and for that I envy you).
* [unofficialgoogledatascience.com](http://www.unofficialgoogledatascience.com) is written by google employees - enough said...
* [Airbnb](http://nerds.airbnb.com/data) has a great data science team, and it shows.
* [Evan Miller](http://www.evanmiller.org) has great posts, e.g.
  [bayesian average ratings](http://www.evanmiller.org/bayesian-average-ratings.html?imm_mid=0dbebb&cmp=em-data-na-na-newsltr_20151111).
* If you're into reading mathematical books, [All of Statistics](http://www.bioinfo.org.cn/~wangchao/maa/w.statistic.pdf)
  is a great one for building the formal theory of statistical concepts.
